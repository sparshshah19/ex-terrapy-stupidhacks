An AI-powered relationship reflection web app that guides users through structured conversations to help them think clearly about relationship situations, including optional simulated responses based on provided context.

-> Note: This project is meant to be funny, do not take it seriously

## What it does
ExTerrapy allows users to:
- Provide relationship context through text and optional screenshots
- Receive adaptive, empathetic responses that guide reflection rather than give direct advice
- Simulate ex-style replies to practice communication in a controlled environment
- Continue multi-turn conversations with session-aware context
